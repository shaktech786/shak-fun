### Example Difference:

**User**: "I'm worried I'm not good enough for my job"

**Before (GPT-4o-mini)**:
> "Remember, growth takes time. What specific aspect of your job concerns you most?"

**After (Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking - as Viktor Frankl)**:
> "Between the stimulus of your fear and your response to it, there lies your freedom to choose. I've seen people in the most desperate situations discover their strength not through denying their inadequacy, but through finding meaning in their struggle to grow. What meaning might this challenge hold for you?"
