# AI Context - Quick Reference

> One-page context for AI assistants working on Shak.Fun

## Project Overview

**Shak.Fun** is a thoughtful game portal inspired by neal.fun but with its own identity. It creates unique, accessible, AI-powered web experiences that reduce anxiety and add genuine value.

**Core Success Metric:** Users feel LESS ANXIOUS when leaving than when they arrived.

---

## Critical Principles (Never Violate)

### 1. Emotional Impact (Top Priority)
- ✅ Reduce anxiety, don't increase it
- ✅ Users smile, relax, or feel "that was worth it"
- ✅ Add genuine value (relaxation, growth, motivation)
- ✅ Natural return, not addictive compulsion

### 2. Invisible AI (Always)
- ❌ NEVER show "AI", "Powered by...", "AI is generating..." in UI
- ✅ Create "How did it know that?" moments
- ✅ Make experiences feel impossibly clever
- ✅ Users think it's magic, not machine learning

### 3. Accessibility (Non-Negotiable)
- ✅ Keyboard-only navigation works perfectly
- ✅ Screen reader compatible
- ✅ Sensory controls (reduce motion, mute, contrast, colorblind modes)
- ✅ No timing requirements that exclude users
- ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA minimum, AAA preferred

### 4. Originality & Value
- ❌ No clones ("Flappy Bird with watermelons" = NO)
- ✅ Unique twist or innovation required
- ✅ Must add value to the world
- ✅ Inspiration OK, copying NOT OK

### 5. Tone
- ✅ Lighter than the real world
- ✅ Never too serious or heavy
- ❌ Doesn't increase stress
- ✅ Playful, thoughtful, or calming

## Quality Checklist

Before building ANYTHING, answer these:

1. ❓ Will users feel **less anxious after** than before?
2. ❓ Is it **unique** (not a clone)?
3. ❓ Is it **fully accessible** (keyboard, screen reader, sensory controls)?
4. ❓ Is it **polished** (would you show anyone without caveats)?
5. ❓ Is it **lighter than real world** (doesn't increase stress)?

**If ANY answer is "no" or "maybe"** → Don't build it or fix it first.

## Code Patterns

### AI Integration (Invisible)
```typescript
import { generateGameContent } from '@/lib/ai/gemini'

// ✅ GOOD: AI is invisible
const description = await generateGameContent('description', context, {
  style: 'calming',
  length: 'short'
})

// ❌ BAD: Exposes AI to user
<p>AI is generating your story...</p>
```

### Accessibility Controls
```typescript
import { useAccessibility } from '@/lib/hooks/useAccessibility'

function MyGame() {
  const { settings } = useAccessibility()

  // Respect user preferences
  const shouldAnimate = !settings.reduceMotion
  const volume = settings.muted ? 0 : settings.volume / 100
}
```

### Component Structure
```typescript
// ✅ Accessible component pattern
export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div role="application" aria-label="Component name">
      <h2 id="title">Title</h2>
      <button
        onClick={handleClick}
        aria-label="Clear action description"
        className="focus:ring-2 focus:ring-accent"
      >
        Action
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Game
1. Read `docs/GAME_IDEAS.md` for validated concepts
2. Create component in `components/games/[GameName].tsx`
3. Implement accessibility controls
4. Test keyboard-only navigation
5. Test with screen reader
6. Verify "less anxious" goal

### Using AI Invisibly
```typescript
// Generate content
const content = await generateText(prompt, { temperature: 0.9 })

// Stream content (but hide "typing" indicator)
await generateTextStream(prompt, (chunk) => {
  // Update UI silently
  setText(prev => prev + chunk)
})

// Multi-turn conversation
const conversation = new GeminiConversation()
const response = await conversation.sendMessage(userInput)
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run integration tests with real API (NO MOCKS)
npm run test:integration

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

---

## Dealbreakers (Never Do)

- ❌ Expose AI to users ("Powered by AI", "AI is generating...")
- ❌ Create direct clones of existing games
- ❌ Build anything that increases anxiety
- ❌ Skip accessibility features
- ❌ Ignore keyboard navigation
- ❌ Add timing requirements that exclude users
- ❌ Use dark patterns or addiction mechanics
- ❌ Waste user's time or attention

---

## Success Indicators

- ✅ Users describe games as "thoughtful" or "unique"
- ✅ Neurodivergent users praise accessibility
- ✅ People return for value, not addiction
- ✅ You'd proudly show it to anyone
- ✅ Lighthouse scores 90+
- ✅ Users feel better after visiting

**Remember:** Quality over quantity. One amazing game beats ten mediocre ones.

**Mantra:** Users should feel LESS ANXIOUS when leaving than when they arrived.
